    // The SHA-256 hardware works in units of 16 words / 64 bytes / 512 bits,
    // called blocks. After the actual `data` goes into the hardware, we have to
    // finish it off with something called Merkle-DamgÃ¥rd (MD) padding. The
    // variety of MD padding specified in the SHA-256 spec is:
    //
    // - Add a 1 bit.
    // - Add enough 0 bits for the current block to reach 448 (mod 512) bits.
    //   (That is, until there are only 64 bits left in the block.) If the block
    //   is already past 448 bits by the time we added the 1, this means
    //   finishing out this block, and then starting a new one with 448 zeros.
    // - Add the length of the original data, _in bits,_ as a 64-bit big-endian
    //   integer to round out the final block to 512 bits.
    // - Add the final block(s) to the digest.
    //
    // (If you're curious, this construction provides a defense against messages
    // of slightly different lengths hashing to the same value.)
    //
    // Since we move data in 32-bit words only, the padding process is slightly
    // simplified here:
    //
    // - If the user data filled its final block, start a new empty one.
    // - Append a word with only its MSB set.
    // - Append words of zeros until two words of space remain in the block.
    //   This may require starting a new block.
    // - Append the high word of the data length in bits, and the low word, in
    //   that order, as big-endian integers.

    // First, separate `data` into some number of whole 16-word blocks, followed
    // by zero or more straggler words, by splitting it at its size rounded down
    // to the next-smallest multiple of 16:
    let (prefix, tail) = data.split_at(data.len() & !0xF);

    // Load the whole blocks into the peripheral, pausing before each block to
