# `tinycrc`

A Rust CRC crate that is tiny.

Most CRC implementations are written with performance in mind, and use lookup
tables (in RAM or ROM) to accelerate operations that can be slow on some
processors. In the case of CRC32, these lookup tables cost 1 kiB per algorithm
used. In very size-constrained applications, that's unacceptable.

In cases where size is more important than performance, consider `tinycrc` -- it
does the same work in about 20% of the space.
